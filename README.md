In many image processing applications, the use of Convolution neural networks (CNN) with deep learning has achieved excellent efficiency. For the identification of similar images, the use of CNN based techniques to remove image features from the final layer and the use of a single CNN structure can be used.. The extraction of learning features and efficient comparison of similarity comprises Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). In CBIR, extraction of characteristics and similarity tests play a vital role. The tests are carried out using a pre-trained model that is trained on millions of images and fine-tuned for the recovery task in two datasets, such as UC Merced Land Use Dataset. For the creation of feature descriptors of images for the recovery process, pre-trained CNN models are used. This technique deals with the extraction of features from the two fully connected layers present in the network of VGG-16 and VGG19 by using separate similarity steps to pass learning and recovery of feature vectors. Without previous knowledge of the images, the proposed architecture demonstrates an outstanding output in extracting the features as well as learning characteristics. By applying different performance metrics.
